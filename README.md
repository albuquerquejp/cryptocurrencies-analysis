# cryptocurrencies-analysis

Blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are hot topics in the current economic environment, either because of the technological innovations linked to them or the great volatility of their assets. There are big differences between the 3 fundamentals mentioned, however, the theory of each one will not be addressed in this analysis, but the variation of the price, in the last 90 days, of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum and ADA, the last one of the Cardano blockchain.

In addition to understanding the price variation, using data provided by CoinGecko APIs, it was possible to go deeper, mathematically and statistically speaking, managing to define linear regression lines regarding the dependence of the prices of the "altcoins" on the price of the bitcoin.

In view of this, it is possible to confirm that Bitcoin prices dictate the trend and general sentiment of the market regarding all other cryptocurrencies, that is, when the price of bitcoin falls, it "drags" the others with it, the same happens with its appreciation.
